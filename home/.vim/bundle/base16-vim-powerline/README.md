# Base16 vim-powerline
See the [Base16 repository](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) for more information.

Since this is a theme for [powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline) you will need to have that installed.

Add this line to your vim config to activate the theme:

    let g:Powerline_colorscheme = 'base16'
